# Projects

The following is a list of projects I've created or am developing, including their state and main contributors.

*If a project isn't listed, it's either because I do not remember enough to elaborate anything or I didn't play a significant role in its development. Note that most of these projects have not had README updates in a long time, and will be updated respectively to the descriptions listed here when I have some time.*

## [rickin: A Rick Astley-inspired website.](https://github.com/dacoder101/rickin)

One of the first full web projects I've created, with multiple pages, some easter eggs, and a semi-presentable navbar. Don't forget, its inspired by Rick Astley!
Access via [dacoder101.github.io/rickin/](https://dacoder101.github.io/rickin/)

Created by me with some help from [@lumauser](https://github.com/lumauser) and inspiration from friends. More credit information is available on the website.

## [savers: Screensavers to pair along with rickin.](https://github.com/dacoder101/savers)

A separate repository for the screen-saver easter eggs on rickin. I may plan to add more in the future, but they will not be added to rickin repository. Access the screensaver list from [dacoder101.github.io/savers/](https://dacoder101.github.io/savers/).

Created by me with inspiration from friends.

## [collatz-calculator: Calculator for the Collatz Conjecture mathematical problem.](https://github.com/dacoder101/collatz-calculator)

One of the cleanest looking HTML/CSS/JS projects I've completed, despite its simple design. The conjecture asks how many steps it takes for the following function to return 0.

Can be accessed via [dacoder101.github.io/collatz-calculator/](https://dacoder101.github.io/collatz-calculator/). Created by me with help from [this Veritasium video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg)

## [math-game-bot: A Discord Bot math-game created with Discord.py](https://github.com/dacoder101/math-game-bot/)

A Discord.py math game bot inspired by those math worksheets where students use a set of numbers, and write equations for every number, in say one through twenty. Made so I can grasp Discord bot development a little more, and just code some Python, which I haven't used to make any large projects for a while.

This project is still being worked on and developed by me.

## [jlox-interpreter: A Java implementation of the Lox interpreter.](https://github.com/dacoder101/jlox-interpreter)

I've had an interest in learning the mechanics behind a programming language, and it was exactly why I started reading [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) and following along in this repository. This was also the first time I've even programmed a real project in Java beyond a simple Hello World, which turned out to be similar to that of other statically typed languages like C++, and was extremely easy to grasp after a little bit of googling.

Guided by Crafting Interpreters with some simple changes.

## [hierarchy-creator: ~~*A CLI ripoff*~~ A CLI Hierarchical text/file editor and manipulator](https://github.com/dacoder101/hierarchy-creator) 

**This project is a public archive as of February 6th, 2024.**

Started this project around 2023 when I began a shift towards more object-oriented Python programming. However, I don't feel I understood the concept well at the time and ended up making a horrible project structure making debugging and adding features very infeasible if not completely impossible. After jumping up a skill level, a massive amount of bugs, and losing interest in continuing it, I abandoned the project a later privated it. Today, it is public and archived as simply a piece of my programming history.

As far as its actual use, I wanted a hierarchical editor for a future project, pyos3 (which I later deleted). It was a text editor going to be integrated into the pyos3 menu that could create a hierarchy with files a user could create and write to. The project didn't do much beyond executing already existing terminal commands, with a somewhat pleasing (but buggy) text interface.

Created by me, it is still my largest project to date.
