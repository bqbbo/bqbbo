# Projects

The following is a list of projects I've created or am developing, including their state and main contributors.

*If a project isn't listed, it's either because I do not remember enough to elaborate anything or I didn't play a significant role in its development (**or temporarily, this commit only,** I haven't had time to write a description for it). Note that most of these projects have not had README updates in a long time, and will be updated respectively to the descriptions listed here when I have some time.*

## [rickin: A Rick Astley-inspired website.](https://github.com/dacoder101/rickin)

One of the first full web projects I've created, with multiple pages, some easter eggs, and a semi-presentable navbar.
Access via [dacoder101.github.io/rickin/](https://dacoder101.github.io/rickin/)

Created by me with some help from [@lumauser](https://github.com/lumauser) and inspiration from friends.

## [savers: Screensavers to pair along with rickin.](https://github.com/dacoder101/savers)

A separate repository for the screen-saver easter eggs on rickin. I may plan to add more in the future, but they will not be added to rickin repository. Access the screensaver list from [dacoder101.github.io/savers/](https://dacoder101.github.io/savers/).

## [collatz-calculator: Calculator for the Collatz Conjecture mathematical problem.](https://github.com/dacoder101/collatz-calculator)

One of the cleanest looking HTML/CSS/JS projects I've completed, despite its simple design. The conjecture asks how many steps it takes for the following function to return 0.
