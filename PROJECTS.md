## My Repositories & Projects

I've developed a few dozen repositories, however most have been deleted due to lack of maintenance or revamp. Below are my notable repositories and the information surrounding them.

### Info on Repos

Most repositories contain code created by me (roughly half of this code was created with the assistance of generative AI). Sections where this is not the case are noted in an inline comment or the project's respective README; respective authors are credited accordingly.

Many of my "finished" projects are not being maintained and probably have a messy codebase. I plan to revive them to fix major bugs and implement missing features. All non-archived repositories are open to any contributions.
