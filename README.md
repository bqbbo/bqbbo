## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm bobbo :D

I'm a fourteen-year-old intermediate programmer who occasionally opens an IDE to experiment with something new. I have knowledge of various languages and CS concepts. Learn more about me by visiting [my website](https://bobboe.live).

I'm looking forward to the next major project, whenever that will be...
