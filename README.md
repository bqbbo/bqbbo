## 👋 Hi there, I'm Bobby

Welcome to my GitHub page! I've been a hobbyist programmer creating web applications, Discord bots, and automation tools since 2020. I create most of my public projects using web-dev languages, **NodeJS**, and **Python**, and have additional experience with **Java**, **C++**, and **React**.

---

### Projects

My major projects include my Discord bots [**birthday-bot**](https://github.com/bqbbo/birthday-bot) and [**math-game-bot**](https://github.com/bqbbo/math-game-bot), and web tools like [**tester**](https://github.com/bqbbo/tester). Additionally, I'm working on larger projects like Java-typed [**jlox**](https://github.com/bqbbo/jlox-interpreter) programming language, and a (currently private) Boy Scout library management system.

Additional project descriptions can be found [**here,**](https://github.com/bqbbo/bqbbo/PROJECTS.md) and my full list of repositories can be found [**here.**](https://github.com/bqbbo?tab=repositories)

### Goals

Some of my future goals for 2026 include,

* Planning and creating an 8-bit breadboard CPU,
* Finishing Crafting Interpreters (including the C portion),
* Implementing a web browser with support for basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
* Beginning work on a highly configurable, multiplatform LMS for a startup.

Additionally, I'd like to get my portfolio website running, complete my Linux development environment, and earn professional cybersecurity certifications.
