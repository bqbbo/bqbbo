<h3>Oi there!</h3>
<p>I've been coding for around 3-4 years now, and have some basic knowledge of Python, HTML & CSS, and little snippets of other programming languages.</p>
<p>I am currently learning C++ and JavaScript. <sub>tho, with the pace i go at, itl be 2045 before I even get to data types tbh</sub></p>
<b>Fiddlesticks! <i>I have to learn OOP next? AAAAAAAAAA</i></b>
